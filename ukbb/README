OA case categories:
------------------

OA SR:
from the MAIN dataset, include samples with 1465 in 20002 category

SR THR due to OA:
from the MAIN dataset, include samples having 1465 in 20002 category AND having 1318 in 20004 category

SR TKR due to OA
from the MAIN dataset, include samples having 1465 in 20002 category AND having 1319 in 20004 category

SR TJR due to OA
from the MAIN dataset, include samples having 1465 in 20002 category AND having either 1318 or 1319 in 20004 category

HD OA
HD KneeOA
HD HipOA
HD HandOA
HD ThumbOA
HD SpineOA
HD FingerOA
HD HipKneeOA
from the HESIN dataset, include samples having at least one ICD code from "OA_case_inclusion_HD_ICD.txt", using appropriate value in the first column for filtering

OPCS4 TKR cases:
First get all HD KneeOA cases (see above); then keep only those samples having OPCS4 code combinations from "OA_case_inclusion_knee_hip_OPCS4.txt" (first column == "TKR")

OPCS4 THR cases:
First get all HD HipOA cases (see above); then keep only those samples having OPCS4 code combinations from "OA_case_inclusion_knee_hip_OPCS4.txt" (first column == "THR")

OPCS4 TJR cases:
Union of the OPCS4 TKR and OPCS4 THR samples (see above)

== After that, for each category, exclude samples based on ICD codes in "OA_case_exclusion.txt" ==

OA controls:
-----------
Starting with the full list of UKBB samples, exclude:
- samples having ICD codes from "OA_control_exclusion_HD_ICD.txt"
- samples having OPCS4 codes from "OA_control_exclusion_OPCS4.txt"
- OPCS4 TKR cases (see above)
- OPCS4 THR cases (see above)
- OA SR cases (see above)
